## Week 1 
7 problems to solve focusing on basic problem solving skills.

### Plus Minus
Given an array of integer, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with **6** places after the decimal.

### Mini-Max Sum
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

### Time Conversion
Given a time in **12**-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

### Breaking the Records
Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

### Camel Case 4
Camel Case is a naming style common in many programming languages. In Java, method and variable names typically start with a lowercase letter, with all subsequent words starting with a capital letter (example: startThread). Names of classes follow the same pattern, except that they start with a capital letter (example: BlueCar).

Your task is to write a program that creates or splits Camel Case variable, method, and class names.

### Divisible Sum Pairs
Given an array of integers and a positive integer **k**, determine the number of **(i, j)** pairs where **i < j** and **ar[i]** + **ar[j]** is divisible by **k**.

### Sparse Arrays
There is a collection of input strings and a collection of query strings. For each query string, determine how many times it occurs in the list of input strings. Return an array of the results.
